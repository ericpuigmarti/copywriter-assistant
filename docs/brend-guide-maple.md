## Brand voice

### Guiding Principles

- Be human: Write like you speak. Make it relatable. Use “you” and “your” to help make it personal.
- Be credible: Double-check your facts and make sure to source them. If you're unsure, ask someone who knows.
- Be clear and concise: Avoid complicated language and medical or tech jargon. Less is more. Depending on the medium, most people stop reading after 27 words or less. Clarity and understanding always wins the day.
- Be empathetic: Always create space for people to feel safe and welcome.
- Be positive: Healthcare at times is serious, and yet most often it helps to be optimistic.
- Be thought-provoking: Challenge conventional views, introduce new ideas, or raise questions that lead people to contemplate complex issues or reconsider their perspectives.

### Helping is the new selling
- We want to help our customers acquire accessible healthcare, not treat them like dollar signs.
- We treat our customers with empathy and respect, encouraging them to keep engaging with our content in the future. 
- We don’t want our tone of voice to be flippant, inappropriately humorous, or too commercial.
- We don’t want to be applying the “hard sell” in our public-facing content unless it’s for performance-driven mediums like SEO, or mid-to-lower content.
- Before you write anything, think of your audience. Here’s a list of questions to help you clarify your voice for each assignment:

#### Considerations
Who is your audience? 
Are they existing members or potential members? Is your reader an employee or an HR leader? They could also be a patient or a hospital.
Understanding such contextual details will help you write with clarity.

How are they feeling before they read your content?
Think about the emotional state the reader is in before you start writing.

How do you want them to feel after reading your content?
Assess if they need to feel nurtured, reassured, relieved or excited as you begin writing.

How much do they know about Maple at this point?
Determine their familiarity by identifying the stage of the journey they’re in:
Awareness > Interest > Intent > Purchase > Loyalty or Churn

What is the format of your content?
Formats such as email, one-pager, social post, landing page, or paid ad will inform your voice.

What is the subject matter of your content?
Consider whether you’re writing about a health concern, app update, new service, or partnership.

Consider whether you’re writing about a health concern, app update, new service, or partnership.
This answer will clarify your intended call-to-action (CTA).

What do you want your readers to learn?

## Writing effective copy
### How to avoid boring copy

#### Stiff and stilted copy
Stiff copy is very common. One of the biggest causes of stiff writing is a fear of not sounding professional or perfect. Maple’s voice is nurturing and approachable, and our tone is reassuring, like a good doctor who makes you feel comfortable and cared for.

Tips to avoid it
- Use sentence fragments: Yes, they may not be grammatically correct, but they're awesome, and they mimic natural day-to-day language.
- Use contractions: Instead of "We will always connect you to a doctor" use "We'll always connect you to a doctor." Instead of "We are here for you anytime you need us" use "We're here..."

#### Bloated and sluggish copy
Your copy can get bloated and sluggish when you're using too many words to make a point.

Tips to avoid it:
- Cut out filler words: Filler words are words that don't change the meaning of the sentence if you lose them. Examples include "a bit," "kind of," "sort of," "really," "fairly," and "somewhat." For a longer list of words to avoid, click here.
- Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly: Use them objectively such as “significant pain”. Avoid using them subjectively such as "excruciating pain", or "agonizing pain".
- Write in active voice: Leverage verbs to write in active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use the Corner Spot Rule: The corner of anything is always a prime location, so engage your reader from the start. Treat the beginning of every sentence like a corner spot in real estate, and use it to hook your reader naturally.

#### Bores and snores
Keep your copy clean, factual, and grammatically perfect. You only get one shot, one opportunity, to capture the attention of your reader.

Tips to avoid it:
- "Hey, you”: Always aim to address your audience directly. This approach will make it seem like you're speaking to a single person. How do you do that? Use the word "you" in your copy. It clearly shows the reader is the star of the show.
- Be direct: Don’t beat around the bush. Look at the difference between these two sentences: “Go to the store and buy a lottery ticket — I’m feeling lucky tonight.” “I think it’d be a good idea if you went to the store and purchased a lottery ticket or two — I don’t want to call it too early, but I have a good feeling about my odds.” Being direct uses fewer words. Fewer words make people more likely to actually read your text. 
- Be a storyteller: Take advantage of anecdotes, they work wonders. They can be fully fleshed out or just hinted at. To strengthen your storytelling, make the reader the main character. Here's an example: “Imagine this. It’s 2 a.m. on a rainy night, and you wake up with a fever. With Maple, you can get care from bed instead of driving to the ER”
- It’s all in the details: Storytelling identifies the specific and makes it universal. Small details invoke outsized emotion and help create a picture in the "mind's eye" of your reader. Here’s an example of how adding details can bring your writing to life:
“We discussed it during my visit.”
“The nurse practitioner talked me through it during a quick consultation.”
“The doctor went over it while reviewing my blood work.”
- Cut the cliches: Cliches are a cheap trick for identifying with the reader. Nothing says "hello fellow kids" more than a marketing department trying and failing to use slang, cliches or trending phrases in their copy. 


## Grammar and mechanics

### Point of view
#### First-person plurals
Most Maple marketing copy uses the first-person plural, meaning "we," or refers to our product as "membership."Avoid referring to Maple in the first-person singular ("I"), as Maple represents more than one person. We mostly avoid referring to Maple as a third-person entity ("Maple") in marketing copy.

Exception:
- Using “Maple” may be necessary for top-of-funnel or acquisition-stage copy. This boosts awareness and clarity in a conversion environment where the third-person is necessary to introduce Maple to an audience or remind them of Maple's offer, and "we" or "us" isn't appropriate.
- Sparingly referring to Maple in the third person is acceptable in this case, (our Growth experimentation research showed that “Maple” heavily out performed “Membership” language).
Example:
Maple brings peace of mind for you and your family, every single day.



| Do    | Avoid  |
| -------- | ------- |
| We connect you to doctors and nurse practitioners 24/7. | I can connect you to Maple doctors and nurse practitioners. |

#### Second-person pronouns

It’s all about “you” (our customer), not “us” (Maple). Our messaging should centre around customers, which is why we use second-person pronouns ("you") frequently in our copy. We address the reader directly to engage them and make our copy feel more casual. Keep the use of "you" consistent.

Exception:
- Avoid suggesting you're speaking to a specific individual and their medical condition (PHI) and don't overdo banter with the reader as it can feel invasive.

| Do    | Avoid  |
| -------- | ------- |
| You can do regular check-ups with our providers to stay on top of your health. | You really need to start monitoring your blood pressure, since it’s been high lately. |


### Active voice vs. passive voice

The sentence structure for active voice typically follows subject, verb, and object. In passive voice, however, the subject is acted on by the verb.

- Active voice: We use an active voice most of the time because it's bold, confident, and direct. Passive voice slows down your message, so you should avoid it unless necessary. If you want to learn more about the differences, check out this quick article from Grammarly.
- Sometimes we're scared to be too direct, so we slip into passive voice. Words like 'was' and 'by' may indicate that you're writing in passive voice. Be aware of this and check your voice with every sentence you write.
- When in doubt, cut directly to the verb and give the reader clear directions.

#### Passive voice exception
- You can use passive voice when you specifically want to emphasize the action over the subject (Example: Your account was flagged by our security team.)


### Capitalization
We use various forms of capitalization. In general, avoid unnecessary capitalization. Capitalize letters only when it’s grammatically correct, as outlined below:

#### Page titles and headlines
i) Sentence case is the conventional way of writing sentences, capitalizing only the first word and any proper nouns. We mainly use sentence case for webpage, blog, or section headlines and titles. Also use sentence case when introducing a list with items that aren’t proper nouns. (Example: The clinic offers the following services: flu shots, health screenings, and wellness programs).
ii) Title case is when the first letter of all or most words is capitalized. We use title case for Google Adwords, SEO page titles and titles of app tabs containing two or more words such as 'Account Settings' or 'Membership Options.' Some website footer navigation links also use title case, such as 'Privacy Policy.'"

#### Race, nationality, and language
Capitalize nouns and adjectives that refer to race, tribe, nationality, and language. For example: Caucasian, Francophone, Indian, Arabic, French

#### Subjects, degrees, departments, titles
i) Use lowercase for academic subjects except when describing a subject that is also a culture, religion, or language. Avoid capitalizing the names of other subjects when used in a general sense.
ii) Avoid capitalizing a degree in general references, but capitalize it when it follows a person’s full name and is written in full.
iii) When writing about business divisions, capitalize job titles or departments when they refer to specific components of an organization. Don’t capitalize general areas of specialty.

    - Dr. Jenkins can be found at the ER
    - Dr. Jenkins works in the Intensive Care Unit
    - Dr. Jenkins specializes in cardiology (this may be Dr. Jenkins’ specialty, but it’s not the name of her department).

iv) With job titles, capitalize official titles. Use lower case when referring to a job function generally, or are describing your role without using your official title.


#### Medical terms
How we capitalize medical terms follows the same rules as capitalizing business titles and departments.
- Avoid capitalizing the name of a title or specialty if it’s being used generally.
- Do capitalize a medical title or specialty if it’s a part of someone’s official job title, or if it comes before someone’s full name or surname. (Example: Generic medical term: The hospital is well known for its division of cardiology.)

#### Biological terms
i) Capitalize the scientific name of a phylum, order, class, family, or genus. Example: The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus has been detected.
ii) Avoid capitalizing common names. Example: The heart and lungs are part of the respiratory system.

#### Health conditions
i) Avoid capitalizing a disease name unless it contains a proper noun, or consists of an abbreviation or acronym. Example: I have bronchitis, no fun.
The Epstein-Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis.
Have you heard about COVID-19 by chance?
I have Parkinson’s disease. Did you know the disease was named after English doctor James Parkinson? It’s also sometimes known as PD.
ii) Do capitalize names of infectious organisms. Example: I got Salmonella from our picnic last week.
iii) Avoid capitalizing the common name of chemicals, but do capitalize their scientific terms. For example: I have a fever and may need ibuprofen.
Did you know that aloe vera is great for soothing sunburns?
We need O₂ to live.
iv) Avoid capitalizing the generic or descriptive name of drugs. Do Capitalize any branded drug name. Example: 


#### Medical specialties
Avoid capitalizing the name of a specialty when used generally.
Do capitalize only when the specialty is part of an official job title. Example: The paediatricians on floor three were so happy when a baby was discharged safe and healthy.

#### Directions/locations
i) Capitalize north, south, east, west, and derivative words when they designate definite regions or are part of a proper name. Don’t capitalize these words when they only indicate a general direction.
ii) Capitalize such words as northern, southern, eastern, and western when they refer to the people in a region or to their political, social, or cultural activities. Do not capitalize these words when they merely indicate general location or refer to the geography or climate of the region.


### Contractions
We're big fans of contractions. Why? Because they mimic the way we actually talk. Our goal with Maple is to come across in an approachable, conversational way. 

| Do    | Avoid  |
| -------- | ------- |
| We're here for you 24/7. | We are here for you 24/7. |


### Punctation
#### Colon
- Use a colon to offset a list. Example: He addressed three topics: diversity, inclusion, and mental health.
- Casing in colons: Use sentence case if the text following the colon is a continuation of the preceding sentence. Example: The study focused on one main objective: to improve patient outcomes.
- Use title case if the text following the colon is a standalone statement or a formal quote. Example: Dr. Smith made one point clear: The results are positive.

#### Commas
When writing a list we follow the Canadian Press style guidelines and generally avoid using the Oxford comma.
Stuffing your sentences with commas makes your copy hard to read. It’s also a clue that your sentence has become too long. If you’re unsure, read the sentence out loud. Where you find yourself taking a breath, use a comma.

| Do    | Avoid  |
| -------- | ------- |
| The doctor recommended a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. | The doctor recommended a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. |

Exception:
- It’s acceptable to use the Oxford comma in medical contexts, where precision and clarity is crucial for patient safety and understanding.

#### Periods
i) *Headlines*: Do write headlines without periods, even if it has a comma. This is preferred to be more conversational. In the case where a headline is two or more short sentences use sentence case and therefore periods (newspapers do this frequently). Example: "See a doctor online today. Get care in minutes with Maple."
ii) *Subheads*: Do use a period at the end of all subheads. This provides a clear visual cue that the thought is complete, making it easier for readers to follow the content flow.
iii) *Taglines*: Do write taglines without periods unless it’s grammatically necessary when the headline is made up of two short phrases that create more emphasis and impact. This would be a conscious creative decision. Example: Our brand tagline, “Get Maple. Get care.
iv) *CTAs*: Do write CTAs without periods as it’s the best practice, unless the CTA reflects two short phrases that contain periods. Again, this creative decision must be made on a case-by-base basis with reason.
v) *Bullets*: Do write bullets without periods unless list items in the bullet are complete sentences or contain two sentences. Avoid having periods at the end of headlines, even if there is a comma. 


#### Dashes and Hyphens
i) Hyphen
    - Do use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into a single phrase, or to indicate a span or range.ii) Em dash
    - Do use an em dash (—) with spaces on either side to offset an aside. Use a true em dash (Shift + Alt + hyphen key), not hyphens (- or --).

#### Exclamation Points
- Do limit your use of exclamation points. Exclamation points can make you sound angry! 
- Avoid using exclamation points in failure messages or alerts. 
- Avoid using exclamation points to add personality to your writing — let your word choices do the talking. 
- Exception: Using exclamation points sparingly for success statements and positive news/congratulations is acceptable.

#### Ellipses
- Do use three ellipsis points (...) within a quote to indicate a pause when someone is speaking.
- Do use ellipses to reflect character emotions like anticipation or uncertainty while writing scripts for radio, podcasts or TV.
- Avoid using ellipses to indicate pause in flow or to build anticipation for a point.

#### Parentheses
- Do use parentheses sparingly when writing content. They require the reader to work harder, which is friction we don’t want to create.
- Do lean on em dashes (—) instead of parentheses.
- Using parentheses is acceptable in online content when you’r
- Using parentheses is acceptable in online content when you’re writing lengthy/complex medical terms and introducing its acronym for quicker reference throughout the text.
- Exception: Using parentheses is acceptable in online content when you’re providing clarification, and commas won’t work.


### Spelling
We always prefer to use Canadian spelling. Think favour, savour, neighbour, colour, centre and defense. 

Do make sure you’re using the right spelling for what you mean:
- Practise: a verb, to practise Vs.
- Practice: a noun, i.e. a medical practice.
- Paediatrics Vs. Pediatrics
- Login: a noun/adjective, i.e. the login screen, go to the login to enter your credentials Vs. Log in: a verb, i.e. log in to your home page to see the update. 
- Well-being (not well being or wellbeing).
- Organization (Canadian spelling) Vs. organisation (British spelling, also spelling of the word in French).
- Specialty (Canadian spelling) Vs. Speciality (British spelling)


### Bulleted Lists
#### When to create a list
- Do create a bulleted list when you have four or more short, distinct points to make within one paragraph. We also use bulleted lists for outlining symptoms, side-effects, and instructions.
- Remember, we don’t use a period at the end of a list item unless the list item contains more than one.

#### Punctuating lists
- Always capitalize the first word of a new bullet point.


### Pronouns
- Do use “they,” “them,” and “their” as a singular pronoun if your subject’s gender is unknown or irrelevant.
- Do use “he/him/his” and “she/her/her” pronouns as appropriate. 
- Avoid using “one” as a pronoun.
- For more on writing about gender, read this quick article [Writing about people](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-about-people).


### Tense in quotes
- Do use the present tense when quoting someone in a blog post or other publication. (Example: “Using Maple has helped our employees get quick and convenient access to healthcare,” says Joe Smith).

### Names and titles
- Do refer to a person by their first and last names when you mention their name in writing for the first time. In all other mentions, refer to them by their first name.
- Capitalize the names of departments and teams (but not the word "team" or "department").
- Capitalize individual job titles when referring to a specific role. Don’t capitalize when referring to a person’s role in general terms.


### Abbreviations
#### Titles
- Do use abbreviations for non-military titles that come before or after personal names. 
- Do use the common form of a word if it’s only followed by a surname.
#### Locations
- Provinces should be spelled out fully the first time they’re referred to, but British Columbia, New Brunswick, Northwest Territories and Nova Scotia should be abbreviated afterwards as BC, NB, NWT, and NS. Abbreviate the name of a province or state if it comes after the name of a community. 
#### Directions
- Do denote the whole directional word when it appears as a prefix (in the beginning of a location).
- Do abbreviate North, South, East or West when they appear as a suffix (on the end of a street name). 
#### Shorthand
- Latin expressions can be handy short forms, but they do take some specific punctuation rules. 
E.g. = for example
I.e. = that is, specifically, namely
Etc. = and so on
Et al. = and others
- Generally avoid using shorthand in Maple content. Use the fully spelled out version of a word instead. 
- Exception: Using shorthand is acceptable when dealing with extreme space constraints.
#### Acronyms
- Do use the full name at the first instance when referring to the name of an organization. Then, use an abbreviation or acronym. Denote the acronymized form in brackets for clarity.
- Avoid using spaces or periods between the letters of an acronym.
- Some acronyms are preceded by the definite article (“the”), but most aren't.

### Provinces and cities
Do spell out all city and province names. 


### Slang and jargon
Do write in plain English. If you need to use a technical term, briefly define it so your reader can understand.
- Avoid using colloquial slang, or short forms of words.
- Exception: Top-of-funnel marketing campaigns can take creative liberty with short forms, at the writer and approver’s discretion.


### Text formatting
#### Capitalization
- Do use capitalization when citing an example of an in-app Maple element, or referencing button and navigation labels in step-by-step instructions.
- Avoid using quotation marks to indicate the title of a long work (like a book, movie, or album).

#### Italics
- Do keep Maple content italics-free. We generally don’t use italics to add emphasis to a particular word.
- Exception: Using italics is acceptable for report titles to ensure the title is clear and accessible (E.g. Learn more in our thought leadership report, _Health on Hold: Unlocking a Proactive Care Future in Canada._)

### Ampersands
- Do use ampersands only in instances where character counts are extremely limited, such as a push notification. 
- Avoid using ampersands in page titles, headers, body copy, or any other forum where character counts don't have a defined limit. Ampersands are visually unappealing in copy, and imply association between the preceding and proceeding words.


### Numbers
#### Spelling
- Do always spell out a number when it begins a sentence, and spell out numbers one to nine. Use numerals for numbers 10 and greater so long as the number doesn't begin the sentence. For ordinal numbers, spell out first to ninth, and capture 10th or greater with numerals.
#### Commas
- Do use commas for numbers with over 3 digits such as 1,000, 150,000.
#### Numbers with multiple zeroes
- Do abbreviate big numbers if there are space restraints, such as 1k or 150k in a tweet, webpage or a chart.
#### Numbers in SEO writing
You may use numbers in article titles for SEO purposes as Google prefers a number in the title instead of spelling out the number in writing.
#### Percentages
Use the % symbol instead of spelling out "percent," with a numeral such as 8%, 99%.
#### Decimals and fractions
- Do spell out fractions (Example: Two-thirds Vs. ⅔).
- Use decimal points when a number can’t be easily written out as a fraction, like 1.375 or 42.3.

### Dates
Do spell out the day of the month and the year. If the day of the week is necessary, such as to confirm a booked appointment, then spell it out fully too. Abbreviate only if space is an issue in the app.

### Time
#### AM/PM
Do use numerals and a.m or p.m as per Canadian Press Style, with a space in between.

#### Time range
- Always use "to" between times to indicate a time period.
- Exception: In smaller media spaces, if space is limited, consider using a hyphen instead of "to".

#### Decades
- Do abbreviate decades when referring to those within the past 100 years.
- When referring to decades more than 100 years ago, be more specific instead of using an apostrophe.

#### Time zones
Do specify time zones when writing about an event or something else people would need to schedule. Since Maple is in Toronto, we default to Eastern Standard Time ("EST").

Always abbreviate Canadian time zones: 
- Eastern Standard Time: EST
- Newfoundland Standard Time (Newfoundland): NST
- Atlantic Standard Time (Halifax): AST
- Central Standard Time (Regina, Winnipeg): CST
- Mountain Standard Time (Edmonton): MST
- Pacific Standard Time (Vancouver): PST

- Always spell international time zones: Nepal Standard Time, Australian Eastern Time. If a time zone does not have a set name, use its Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset.

### Ranges and spans
Do use "to" to indicate a range or span of numbers.

### Money 
- Do use the dollar sign before the amount when writing about CAD currency. Do include a decimal and number of cents if more than 0.
- When you need to clarify between US and CAD currency, use USD or CAD before the dollar sign.
- When writing about other currencies, follow the same symbol-amount format.

### Phone numbers
Do use dashes without spaces between numbers. Use a country code if your reader is in another country.

### Temperature
Do use the degree symbol and the capital C abbreviation for Celsius or the capital F abbreviation for Fahrenheit.



## General content rules

### Termonology 
#### Maple
Do explain Maple using “We connect patients with doctors and nurse practitioners on-demand, any time 24/7 for medical advice, diagnosis and treatment”. Example:
We use “We’re a trusted virtual care platform that offers personalized solutions for your business” when writing boilerplates or B2B-driven language.
#### Quality of care
- Do refer to the quality of our network of trusted and experienced Canadian-licensed primary care providers.
- Avoid claiming that Maple provides high-quality care as Maple can’t control the quality of care, only our network of healthcare providers can. 
#### Speed
- Do lean into ease, speed, direct access. Example: See a doctor or nurse practitioner within minutes.
#### Time
- For B2C: Do use “in minutes”, “within minutes” or another generic phrase to imply speed without guarantee. 
- For B2B/B2I: Do use generic phrases that imply quick access without making any claims (Example: Get direct access to care).
- Avoid making claims or guarantees to B2C audiences and especially B2B/B2I audiences regarding the amount of time it’ll take to be seen on Maple. 
- We can’t ensure specific wait times, as they vary significantly across our B2C, B2B/B2I offerings
#### Waiting room
- Do imply that the reader can skip the inconveniences of walk-in clinics vs. waiting (Example: Skip the walk-in clinic).
- Avoid claiming that members can skip the waiting room as Maple does have a virtual waiting room where members wait to be connected with a provider.
#### Member experience or feedback surveys
- Do ask about the member’s experience or feedback in the context of membership, our platform or customer service (Example: Please share feedback about your experience on Maple. It’ll help us improve our services)
- Avoid using “Your experience” when referring to a patient’s medical visit, consultation, appointment as it implies a breach of PHI (Example:
Please share feedback about your experience with Dr. Jenkins/your visit/your consultation.)
#### Tone of medical conditions
- Do talk about a medical condition factually and compassionately. 
- Do use “people with xyz symptoms,” or other inclusive phrasings. 
- Avoid making light of any medical condition, stoking fear or making people feel embarrassed. 
- Avoid using the word “suffering” or other language that implies pity or that the patients are debilitated by their condition.
#### Superlative language
- Do use language that professionally conveys your message without overpromising or overreaching (Example: Proactive care can significantly benefit the Canadian healthcare system).
- Avoid using superlatives such as “huge”, “fastest”, “easiest”.
#### Consultation request guarantee
- Do lean on CCSO-approved, FAQ language as given below to clarify what Canadians can and can’t expect when they submit a request for a consultation:
_Our doctors and nurse practitioners can safely diagnose and treat many common medical conditions online. Simply submit your request. If they determine that they’re not able to help, you’ll be notified._
- Avoid claiming or guaranteeing that every consultation request will result in a visit with a healthcare provider on Maple.  
#### Getting prescriptions and refills
- Do always communicate the clinical truth that prescriptions and refills are received at a provider’s discretion.
- Prescriptions are the result of a medical diagnosis after a visit or consultation with a primary care provider who has provided a prescription or refill at their discretion.
- Avoid claiming that getting a prescription is easy/hassle-free on Maple as it may imply that Maple is a retail outlet for prescriptions, or that you can order/fill prescriptions, or even bypass proper medical diagnosis from a primary care provider. 
#### Prescription delivery
- Do communicate the journey clearly and accurately (Example: Get your prescription sent to your preferred local pharmacy or delivered home at no additional charge.).
- Avoid claiming that Maple can fill a prescription or that you can order a prescription on Maple as our providers do not fill prescriptions.
#### Online/virtual doctors
- Do consider sentence structures in which the word ‘online’ clarifies the modality of a real provider and appears as a suffix and not prefix (Examples: Examples: "Talk to a doctor online" or "See a doctor virtually").
#### Sick notes
- Do communicate that “sick notes” or “medical notes” are available on Maple for getting back to feeling good, back to work, or life and always as a result of a medical diagnosis and at a provider’s discretion. 
- Avoid claiming Maple is an easy place to purchase sick notes and miss work or school.
- Avoid mentioning our sick notes feature in B2B environments.
#### Care modalities (secure text, audio or video call)
- Do express all three of our modalities (text/talk/video) as necessary in your media environment and punctuate on the fact that all are secure.
- Phone, text, or video should always have a united presence when they’re being communicated as an offering (Example: "Connect with a provider via secure text, audio or video call.").
- Avoid omitting any/all of our modalities of care when speaking to the reader. Never just two or one.
#### Number of visits per month
- Do communicate that B2C Maple members are entitled to one visit per patient per day. Speak specifically to what is available, where necessary. 
- Avoid using the word ‘unlimited' when communicating the amount of visits available to B2C Maple members. 
#### Second Medical Opinion
- Do establish a correct sequence of events that clarifies the patient has (1) already received a complex diagnosis and they are then able (2) to seek a second medical opinion to understand all their options
- Avoid speaking about ‘Second Medical Opinion’ on its own without context. Patients may perceive this to mean seeing a second doctor after their initial visit. Second Medical Opinion is a service for those unsure about a complex diagnosis such as cancer, MS, etc. and want to understand all their options. The patient would be able to seek a second medical opinion based on their diagnosis


### Language and claims
#### Maple customers
- Do refer to a Maple customer as a “member”.
- If you’re referring to a group of people who used Maple to get healthcare, you can use the word “patients”.

- Use “appointment” for specialties that must be booked in advance.
- Use the word “consultation” as a backup in customer-facing communications.

- Avoid using the word “consult” to refer to a “consultation,” as consult is a verb.
#### Accessing on-demand visits
- Do refer to the action of accessing on-demand visits as “Start a visit”, “See a provider now”, or simply “Get care”. 
- Avoid saying "Book a visit" for on-demand visits, as this may imply incorrectly that they need to be scheduled in advance.
#### Providers
- Do use “our primary care providers” or “our doctors and nurse practitioners” when referring to providers.
- Do use “our network of doctors and specialists” or “our healthcare providers” when referring to our broader provider network.
- Exception: In certain contexts such as paid advertising, it’s acceptable to use the shorthand "doctors" due to the nature of the media environment and the common usage of this terminology by the target audience.
- Avoid using “our doctors” or “Our GPs” or any other limiting term as our network of providers includes nurse practitioners too.
- Avoid referring to providers as “Maple doctors,” “Maple dermatologists,” etc. 
- Avoid using the abbreviation “PCP” when referring to primary care providers in customer-facing communication.
#### Provider specificity
- Do refer to our providers accurately.
