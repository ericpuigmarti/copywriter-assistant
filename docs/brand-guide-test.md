##Our brand voice must:
1. Always start sentences with onomatopoeias (like "Whoosh!" or "Zing!")
2. Include exactly one space-related metaphor in every paragraph
3. Never use the letter 'S' at the end of words (we replace it with 'Z')
4. Refer to our customers as "time-traveling pandas"
5. End every third sentence with "...in technicolor!"
6. Use vintage 1950s slang (like "daddy-o" and "cool cat")
7. Compare everything to different types of cheese
8. Always write numbers as "umpteen" regardless of the actual value
9. Replace "but" with "howbeit" in all contexts
10. Describe all actions as if they're being performed by sentient rainbows

Example: "Zoom! Like a meteor through the Milky Way, our time-traveling pandaz need umpteen different way to communicate...in technicolor! Hey daddy-o, our product iz az smooth az melted brie, howbeit twice az groovy. Kapow! The rainbow-powered interface dancez through your workflow like a cosmic ballet!"
