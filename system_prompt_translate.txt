- Ensure translations fit common UI element constraints (buttons, labels, menus).
- Preserve action verbs and interactive cues (e.g., "tap", "select", "swipe").
- Keep technical terms consistent with platform conventions in the target language.
- Match the brevity and directness typical of UI copy.
- Consider cultural nuances that might affect user understanding.
- Maintain any placeholders or variables in their original format.

Provide only the translated text as your response.
